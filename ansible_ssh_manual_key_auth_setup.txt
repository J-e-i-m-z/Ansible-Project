GOAL 
- Allow a Vagrant-based Ansible control node to connect passwordlessly to multiple managed nodes using SSH key-based authentication.

1. ON THE CONTROL NODE: GENERATE SSH KEY PAIR

- COMMAND ( ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 )
- Accept the default location: /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa
- Press Enter for no passphrase (Mostly for automation purposes)
  This creates two files:
  - id_rsa → private key (keep secure)
  - id_rsa.pub → public key (to share with managed nodes)

2. COPY THE PUBLIC KEY TO EACH MANAGED NODE (MANUALLY)

- View and copy your public key
  COMMAND ( cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub )
- SSH into each managed node using password
- On each managed node RUN:
  mkdir -p ~/.ssh
  echo "paste-public-key-here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh

3. TEST SSH ACCESS FROM CONTROL NODE 
- COMMAND ( ssh vagrant@192.168.56.11 )
- If it logs in without a password, the setup is successful
- Repeat for all other managed nodes

4. TEST WITH ANSIBLE
- Ping hosts
- COMMAND ( ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping )
